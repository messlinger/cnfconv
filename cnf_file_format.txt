
CNF data file format
====================

0x00   file header

general information:
--------------------
Marker Info Status

This status page includes data related to the current marker positions such as start/end channel and energy, centroid channel and energy, FWHM and FWTM, integral, area, etc.

Time Info Status

This status page includes items such as acquire start time, dead time, elapsed live and real times and total counts, along with the preset values for total counts as well as for live and real time.

Sample Info Status:

This status page includes sample-related information such as ID, description, sample deposition date/time, quantity and units, and geometry ID.

Calibration Info Status

This status page shows the current energy, FWHM, and tail calibration equations. It also shows the efficiency calculated at (the energy of) the current cursor position.

Display Info Status

This status page includes data related to the current display window and the current ROI (defined by the current marker positions). This includes information such as start and end channels and VFS of the display window/spectrum, and the width, net cps, and total cps of the current ROI. The data is for the expand window if expand is on; it is for the compare spectrum if compare is on and the compare spectrum is currently selected.
